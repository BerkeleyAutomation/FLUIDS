# Urban Driving Simulator
This repository contains a rudimentary driving simulator for autonomous driving in urban environments. The package implements a OpenAI Gym environment describing a city scene with cars and pedestrians.

This package is substantially modified from http://github.com/WesleyHsieh/gym-driving.

Currently under development.
