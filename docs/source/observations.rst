Observations
============
Observations are generated for each controlled car in the scene. The type of observation can be specified in the config file as 'raw', 'Q-LIDAR', or 'bitmap'. The step function in the environment returns an observation for each controlled car in the scene as a list. 

Raw
^^^
A pointer to the raw environment, giving agents full access to the scene, and all other objects in the scene.

Q-LIDAR
^^^^^^^
A representation based on features a autonomus vehicle might extract from LIDAR sensors, which is the relative distance to collideable objects in the scene. This is a numpy array of distances produced by a Featurizer. The density and range of the Q-LIDAR beams can be configured in the featurizer.

Bitmap
^^^^^^
Returns a Numpy image array as generated by the visualizer, for vision-based control agents. Image is a top-down view of the intersection.
